# Brief – Chess Ascension

## Vision  
Chess Ascension is a web-game combining classical chess gameplay with light RPG elements. It is designed for fast, session-based play where each match is single, but player progression persists across sessions. Two modes: Classic and RPG. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Zustand and lightweight backend (NestJS or Firebase).

## Key Outcomes  
- Provide a familiar chess experience but with a fresh twist.  
- Deliver a polished, demo-ready MVP within the hackathon timeframe.  
- Enable progression mechanics to boost user retention and engagement.

## Target Audience  
- Casual players who enjoy quick matches.  
- Chess enthusiasts looking for a fresh variation.  
- Users motivated by unlockables, ranks, skins, light progression.

## Core Metrics  
- Number of sessions played per user.  
- Average score per session.  
- Conversion from score → XP → level.  
- Retention: return users after one week.

## Unique Proposition  
Classic chess vs AI + unlockable abilities & skins, while preserving simplicity and fast sessions.

## Timeline & Scope  
**MVP (V1)**: Classic Mode fully functional, user registration/profile, scoring and XP.  
**Extended (V2)**: RPG Mode with in-game abilities, skins, ranks, unlocking system.
